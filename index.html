            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>Every day we hear artists and songwriters complain about the music industry’s “lack of transparency,” and how they are not getting paid what they deserve from the digital exploitation of their music. Yet global subscription streaming in 2015 was up 39% from the prior year, and ad-supported streaming was up 38.6%. All the while, companies like Pandora, Spotify, Deezer, Apple, YouTube and others are paying hundreds of millions of dollars to rightsholders for the privilege of performing and distributing music on their online and mobile music services, making it almost impossible for them to turn a profit.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>How can this be? Why is the money being paid by digital music services to record labels and music publishers (and collection organizations on their behalf) not making it to the bank accounts of artists and songwriters? There are a multitude of possible reasons, but an important one is that a portion of the money being paid is not being allocated because of the difficulty of identifying the contributors and how they should get paid. What happens to these royalties? They end up in the proverbial “black box”, where royalty revenue is held because it cannot be accurately identified.&nbsp;</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>&nbsp;Services and PROs that can’t distinguish a rightful royalty recipient end up placing this money into escrow accounts and eventually distributing these unattributable monies to labels and publishers based on market share. Such monies are usually not shared with artists or composers signed to those labels or publishers since they can’t be attributed to any rightful creator.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">Soundbit will attempt to describe how &nbsp;technology blockchain can help solve the problem of artist royalties and payments by providing transparency to the complicated chain of rights ownership and usage in the digital distribution of music.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
